## Introduction 

**Git** Is the local version control system VCS on your machine

**Github** The central system for hosting your files online for others to see and use with Git

**What is a Version Control System?**
It tracks changes to a specific resource over time. Things like Google Docs also have VCS, but slightly different.

The VCS works specifically not by saving all unique versions but by **tracking changes** - so a specific version can be generated by understanding all of the changes made since the original (similar to database change logs work).

Systems like Git work locally first - Git tracks changes on your computer to the files that you want tracked. Most systems now also have a distributed system (e.g., GitHub) that allows all users to have the complete source code (clone), and a central server also has this source code. This allows greater durability of the code (in case of one computer crashing) and also allows collaboration.

**What is Git?**
Git is for tracking changes in any set of files at speed. It is distributed and focuses on data integrity and supports non-linear workflows

**Git architecture**

**Working Directory** Where we are working on the project by editing files.

**.git directory** Inside the working directory- this stores information about your project (commit history, etc.) for git to use. When we get information out of the .git directory into the working directory, it’s called a `git checkout`

**Index / Staging area** Inside the .git directory. When we ask git to put new changes into its database of changes, they are added to the staging area using `git add`. Once we then want those staged changes to be durably written - and transferred from the staging area to the .git folder, we do a `git commit`.

**Remote server** The remote git repository where files are stored and shared. We interact with this using `git clone`, `git fetch`, `git push`, and `git pull`.

### basic git commands
|command	|description|
|---|---|
|git init	|Create empty Git repo in specified directory. Run with no arguments to initialize the current directory as git repository.|
|git clone \<repo\>	|Clone repo located at <repo> onto local machine. Original repo can be located on the local filesystem or on a remote machine via HTTP or SSH.|	
|git config user.name \<name\>	|Define author name to be used for all commits in current repo. Devs commonly use --global flag to set config options for current user.|
|git add \<directory\>	|Stage all changes in <directory> for the next commit. Replace <directory> with a \<file\> to change a specific file.|
|git commit -m "\<message\>"	|Commit the staged snapshot, but instead of launching a text editor, use \<message\> as the commit message.|
|git status	|List which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked.|
|git log	|Display the entire commit history using the default format. For customization see additional options.|
|git diff	|Show unstaged changes between your index and working directory.|
|git diff HEAD| Show difference between working directory and last commit.
|git diff --cached| Show difference between staged changes and last commit|

### Git Branches
|command	|description|
|---|---|
|git branch|	 List all of the branches in your repo. Add a \<branch\> argument to create a new branch with the name \<branch\>.|
|git checkout -b \<branch\> |	Create and check out a new branch named \<branch\>. Drop the -b flag to checkout an existing branch |
|git merge \<branch\> |	Merge \<branch\> into the current branch.|

### undoing changes
|command	|description|
|---|---|
|git revert \<commit\>|	Create new commit that undoes all of the changes made in \<commit\>, then apply it to the current branch.|
|git reset \<file\>|	Remove \<file\> from the staging area, but leave the working directory unchanged. This unstages a file without overwriting any changes|
|git clean -n |	Shows which files would be removed from working directory. Use the -f flag in place of the -n flag to execute the clean.|

### Rewriting Git History
|command	|description|
|---|---|
|git commit --amend|	Replace the last commit with the staged changes and last commit combined. Use with nothing staged to edit the last commit’s message.|
|git rebase \<base\>|	Rebase the current branch onto \<base\>. \<base\> can be a commit ID, a branch name, a tag, or a relative reference to HEAD.|
|git reflog	|Show a log of changes to the local repository’s HEAD. Add --relative-date flag to show date info or --all to show all refs.|


### Remote Repositories

|command	|description|
|---|---|
|git remote add \<name\> \<url\>|	Create a new connection to a remote repo. After adding a remote, you can use \<name\> as a shortcut for \<url\> in other commands.Undoing Changes|
|git fetch\<remote\> \<branch\>|Fetches a specific \<branch\>, from the repo. Leave off \<branch\> to fetch all remote refs.|
|git pull \<remote\> |	Fetch the specified remote’s copy of current branch and immediately merge it into the local copy.|
|git push\<remote\> \<branch\>|	Push the branch to \<remote\>, along with necessary commits and objects. Creates named branch in the remote repo if it doesn’t exist.|

### Git config 
|command	|description|
|---|---|
|git config --global user.name \<name\>	|Define the author name to be used for all commits by the current user.|
|git config --global user.email \<email\>	|Define the author email to be used for all commits by the current user.|
| git config --global alias. \<alias-name\> \<git-command\> | Create shortcut for a Git command. E.g. alias.glog log --graph --oneline will set git glog equivalent to git log --graph --oneline.|
|git config --system core.editor \<editor\> |	Set text editor used by commands for all users on the machine. \<editor\> arg should be the command that launches the desired editor (e.g., vi).|
|git config --global --edit	| Open the global configuration file in a text editor for manual editing.|

### Git log
|command	|description|
|---|---|
|git log -\<limit\>|	Limit number of commits by \<limit\>. E.g. git log -5 will limit to 5 commits.|
|git log --oneline|	Condense each commit to a single line.|
|git log -p |	Display the full diff of each commit.|
|git log --stat|	include which files were altered and the relative number of lines that were added or deleted from each of them|
|git log --author=”\<pattern\>”|	Search for commits by a particular author.|
|git log --grep=”\<pattern\>”|	Search for commits with a commit message that matches \<pattern\>.|
|git log \<since\>..\<until\>|	Show commits that occur between <since> and <until>. Args can be a commit ID, branch name, HEAD, or any other kind of revision reference|
|git log -- \<file\>|	Only display commits that have the specified file.|
|git log --graph --decorate	--graph| flag draws a text based graph of commits on left side of commit msgs. --decorate adds names of branches or tags of commits shown.|

### git reset
|command	|description|
|--- |--- |
|git reset|	Reset staging area to match most recent commit, but leave the working directory unchanged|
|git reset --hard|	Reset staging area and working directory to match most recent commit and overwrites all changes in the working directory.|
|git reset \<commit\>|	Move the current branch tip backward to \<commit\>, reset the staging area to match, but leave the working directory alone.|
|git reset --hard \<commit\>|	Same as previous, but resets both the staging area & working directory to match. Deletes uncommitted changes, and all commits after \<commit\>.|
