ngnix is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. 

NGINX is one of the most popular web servers in the world. Not only is NGINX a fast and reliable static web server, it is also used by a ton of developers as a reverse-proxy that sits in front of their APIs.

In this tutorial we will take a look at the NGINX Official Docker Image and how to use it. We’ll start by running a static web server locally then we’ll build a custom image to house our web server and the files it needs to serve. We’ll finish up by taking a look at creating a reverse-proxy server for a simple REST API and then how to share this image with your team.
