## docker 

docker is a containerization platform that packages your application and all its dependencies together in the form of a container to ensure that your application works seamlessly in any environment. 

Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. 

**installation:**
read installation.sh
