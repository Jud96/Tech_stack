## Resource dependencies

Resource dependencies are the relationships between resources in a Terraform configuration. Terraform uses these dependencies to determine the order in which resources are created, updated, and destroyed.

we use depends_on to create dependencies between resources. This ensures that the resources are created in the correct order.

explicit dependencies are created using the depends_on argument.
```terraform
resource "local_file" "whale" {
  filename   = "/root/whale"
  content    = "whale"
  depends_on = [local_file.krill]
}
resource "local_file" "krill" {
  filename = "/root/krill"
  content  = "krill"
}
```
implicit dependencies are created when one resource references another resource's attribute.


```terraform
-- key.tf

resource "tls_private_key" "pvtkey" {
  algorithm = "RSA"
  rsa_bits  = 4096
}

resource "local_file" "key_details" {
  content  = tls_private_key.pvtkey.private_key_pem
  filename = "/root/key.txt"
}
```
```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```
